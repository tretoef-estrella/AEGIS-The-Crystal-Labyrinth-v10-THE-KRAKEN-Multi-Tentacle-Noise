### Acknowledgments

AEGIS was developed through a multi-AI collaborative process:

- **Claude** (Anthropic) — Lead engine: architecture design, full implementation, all code
- **Gemini** (Google) — Geometry & scale advisor: streaming architecture, Frobenius constructions, counter-illumination theory
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) — Tensor & spectral advisor: spectral subspace attack design, cross-line mixing proposal, structural risk assessment
- **Grok** (xAI) — MinRank & statistical advisor: IGCR attack design, corruption boundary analysis, entropy proofs

Six rounds of adversarial audit were conducted, with each AI system explicitly tasked with breaking the system.

### Note on Attribution

AEGIS is the original work of Rafael Amichis Luengo. The AI systems listed above served as collaborators, auditors, and adversaries — not as co-authors. All architectural decisions, creative direction, and final judgment were made by the human architect.
